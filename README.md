## Job Application Tracker: Terms of Use & Privacy Policy
Mikaela Caron operates the website and the “Job Application Tracker” mobile application (the “Service”) (name on the App Store subject to change for search and discovery purposes).

The app is made available to you on an “as in”, “with all faults and “as available” basis. I cannot guarantee that the app will function or maintain the same level of service in the future. That is applicable for both free and paid users.

Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of “Job Application Tracker”. By downloading “Job Application Tracker”, your use of the app is at your own discretion and risk. “Job Application Tracker” makes no claims or promises with respect to the quality, the accuracy or reliability of the app, its safety or security, or its content.

## Why do I need to collect and process some of your data?
The app only collects analytics data and doesn’t story any inputs you would enter in it. It’s only a simple tool to do regular checks on a daily basis.

## What kind of data is stored?
All data stored is 100% anonymous.

### A. Usage data:
We may also collect information based on your usage of the app. This is always done with the sole purpose of improving the experience for “Job Application Tracker”’s users.

Examples: e.g. frequency and duration of usage, significant events and encountered errors if application has crashed etc. Some of this data is processed by Firebase Analytics (which tracks user engagement and major events happening inside the app to provide insights to developers) and Crashlytics (which provide crash reporting insights allowing developers to fix issues faced by users while they experience the app).

I am also relying on Google Analytics to capture website analytics for this webpage which sits on my personal website even though you are most likely reading it from within the app. When your are browsing my website, small files (known as “cookies”) are saved onto your device to collect analytics information about how users browse the site by our analytics service.

Internet address of your computer, tablet or phone is anonymised in the analytics service I use and these cookies are not used to identify you personally. You can opt-out of analytics cookies at any time.

## Where is your data stored?
I use Firebase to store your data in a secure way.
